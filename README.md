This is my current code portfolio. I have some excel macros I have written in vba, but python is my mistress.

Most of my portfolio consists of class projects.I wrote nine programs in my intro to programming class. I planned to rewrite these at some point, but I've focused on other projects instead. I believe all of the programs except Program 7 & 8 compile correctly. I need to go back remove some of the bugs in those programs.


I am currently working on increasing my back end development skills, I will add those to my repository as well. I am currently working on a project using Python Flask and MariaDB. Further commits to come soon
